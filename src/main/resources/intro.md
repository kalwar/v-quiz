# Quiz with Vaadin & Wildfly

This is a small example application to demonstrate scalability features of Wildfly and
Vaadin - especially with constantly open modern WebSocket communication. Questions are 
raised from the admin view (at ./admin/) and contenders try to figure out the 
answers. Sources for the game are available from [github](https://github.com/mstahv/v-quiz).
